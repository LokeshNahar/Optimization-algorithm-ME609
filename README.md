# Optimization-Methods-ME609
This repository was a course project under the supervision of Prof. Deepak Sharma at IIT Guwahati. The Project is divided into 3 phases. In the first phase, for any single variable function, the code finds the optimal point and value of the function using the bounding Phase and Interval Halving method. In the second phase of the assignment, the program was extended for multivariable functions, implementing the Powells conjugate Direction method. In the third phase, we introduced constrained optimization in the multivariable function. Utilized Penalty Methods such as the bracket operator method to deal with the constraints.
